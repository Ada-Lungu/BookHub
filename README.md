# BookHub

The project implements a CMS system as a books review blog, with two types of users:
the guest users and an administrator.

The administrator is actually the blogger, who has a profile and can add and edit profiles of books.
He/she can upload pictures, add information about the book, write and update book reviews, delete books profiles. 

Guest users are displayed an overview of all books, with a brief description, and can choose to get 
more details of wanted books. On the reviewing page, they can exchange comments about the book/review.
Guest users do not have to login to participate in exchange of ideas.
